CocoaCampApp
============

The app was built for an application to Cocoa Camp 2013. I did get in.
I hope it will be useful for some of you!

It’s a simple currency converter and the project was meant to show especially coding skills.

The app was completely written in less than 3 days which obviously wasn’t enough to make it a piece of the art (especially design sucks) ;)
