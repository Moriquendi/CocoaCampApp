	<string>The Canadian dollar (sign: $; code: CAD) is the currency of Canada. As of 2012, the Canadian dollar is the 6th most traded currency in the world. It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or C$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents
In 1858, bronze 1¢ and 0.925 silver 5¢, 10¢ and 20¢ coins were issued by the Province of Canada. Except for 1¢ coins struck in 1859, no more coins were issued until 1870, when production of the 5¢ and 10¢ was resumed and silver 25¢ and 50¢ were introduced. Between 1908 and 1919, sovereigns (legal tender in Canada for $4.86 2⁄3) were struck in Ottawa with a &quot;C&quot; mintmark. Gold $5 and $10 coins were issued between 1912 and 1914.</string>
