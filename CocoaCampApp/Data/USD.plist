History
On 15 January 1520, Bohemia began minting coins from locally mined silver in Joachimsthal known as &quot;Joachimsthaler&quot;. This name became shortened in common usage to thaler or taler. The German name Joachimsthal literally means Joachim&apos;s valley or Joachim&apos;s dale. This name found its way into other languages: Czech tolar, Hungarian tallér, Danish and Norwegian (rigs) daler, Swedish (riks) daler, Icelandic dalur, Dutch (rijks) daalder or daler, Ethiopian ታላሪ (&quot;talari&quot;), Italian tallero, Flemish daelder, Polish Talar, Persian Dare, as well as - via Dutch - into English as dollar.</string>
